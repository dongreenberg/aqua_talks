    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A library for Quantum Algorithms & Applications is more than a collection of procedural code wrapped in Python functions. It needs to provide tools to make writing algorithms simple and easy. This is the layer of modules between the circuits and algorithms, providing the language and computational primitives for Quantum algorithms research.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Aqua, we call this layer the Operator flow. It works by unifying computation with theory through the common language of functions and operators in a way which preserves physical intuition and programming freedom. In the Operator flow, we construct functions over binary variables, manipulate those functions with operators, and evaluate properties of these functions with measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, we'll describe the key players in the Operator flow, and show some examples of how they can be used to construct some familiar quantum algorithms. This notebook assumes a basic familiarity with Quantum Algorithms."

    "1. The Operator flow is a large and self-referential system. Do not worry if you don't immediately feel comfortable with all of its moving parts - like any system of abstractions, it can take time and play to feel comfortable. We feel that this is a worthwhile investment, as once you begin to feel comfortable with the system, algorithm development is super fast and easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Qiskit 0.19 release includes the ***v0*** version of the Operator flow, and there are plenty of kinks to work out. We appreciate your patience, diligence to point out bugs, feedback (by [filing bugs in github](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/issues) ), and contributions as the Operator flow matures."

    "* *Physically Formal* - The Operator flow was built to be mathematically formal down to its very bottom primitives, so that it may serve as a lingua franca between the theory and implementation of Quantum algorithms.\n",

    "* *Powerful OR Readable* - We've tried to let any operation be as succinct or verbose as you want it to be, including both rich syntactic sugar and long-form interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Fast by Default* - We use thoughtfully selected defaults so that algorithms run as fast as possible at many scales, and so you only need to toggle the settings you care about. We want you to be able to trust that we're running your problem as fast as we can, and if you find a way to run it faster, you should [let us know!](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/issues)"

    "### Basic Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before getting into the details of the code, it's important to note that three mathematical concepts unpin the Operator flow. We derive most of the inspiration for the code structure from [John Watrous's Quantum Information formalism](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~watrous/TQI/) (but do not follow it exactly), so it may be worthwhile to review Chapters I and II, which are free online, if you feel the concepts are not clicking.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"State functions\"** - An $n$-qubit State function is a complex function over $n$ binary variables, which we will often refer to as _$n$-qubit binary strings_. For example, the traditional quantum \"zero state\" is a 1-qubit state function, with a definition of $Zero(0) = 1$ and $Zero(1) = 0$. It is often convenient to think about State functions as traditional kets (i.e. $Zero = |0\\rangle$), but be warned, **State functions need not be normalized.** They are just functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Operators\"** - An $n$-qubit Operator is a linear function taking $n$-qubit state functions to $n$-qubit state functions. For example, the Pauli X Operator is defined by $X(Zero) = One$ and $X(One) = Zero$. Therefore, $X(Zero)(0) = 0$. Equivalently, an Operator can be defined as a complex function over two n-qubit binary strings, and it is sometimes convenient to picture things this way. By this definition, our Pauli $X$ can be defined by its typical matrix elements, $X(0, 0) = 0$, $X(1, 0) = 1$, $X(0, 1) = 1$, $X(1, 1) = 0$. In the Operator flow, our Operators are all binary, square Operators (for now).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Measurements\"** - An $n$-qubit Measurement is a functional taking n-qubit State functions to complex values. For example, a Pauli Z Measurement can be defined by $Z_{meas}(Zero) = 1$ and $Z_{meas}(One) = -1$. Measurements are simply adjoints of State Functions, and can be imagined by quantum mechanics' _bra_ notation (i.e. $Zero_{meas} = Zero^{\\dagger} = \\langle 0|$). In thinking of Measurements as adjoints of State functions, note that $Z_{meas}$ above is equivalent to $1 - 2*(\\langle Zero| + \\langle One|)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Throughout this tutorial, we will refer to the mathematical function (of type 1-3 above) that a Python Object represents as that Object's *characteristic function*.**"

    "* As function composition: $Zero_{meas} \\circ Z \\circ X \\circ Zero = 0$\n",

    "* Operators, objects which represent functions or functionals, all deriving from `OperatorBase`: \n",
    "    * `PrimitiveOp`s - Basic Operator building blocks, whose behavior are defined by some internal computational primitive from Terra, such as a Terra's `Pauli` (`PauliOp`), `Operator` (`MatrixOp`), or `QuantumCircuit` (`CircuitOp`).\n",
    "    * `StateFn`s - A class for representing both State functions and Measurements, the behavior of which is defined by some internal primitive, e.g. a simple dict (`DictStateFn`), Terra's `Statevector` (`VectorStateFn`), a `QuantumCircuit` (`CircuitStateFn`), or an OperatorBase representing a density operator (`OperatorStateFn`).\n",
    "    * `ListOp`s - Classes for representing composite Operators, State functions, and Measurements constructed from expressions of others, such as addition (`SummedOp`), composition (`ComposedOp`), tensor product (`TensoredOp`), and concatination into a list (`ListOp`).\n",
    "    * `EvolvedOp` - A special case of a `PrimitiveOp` holding an `Operatorbase` as its primitive, serving as a placeholder for an evolution algorithm to convert later into an Operator approximating the exponentiation of the `OperatorBase`.\n",
    "* Converters, objects which manipulate Operators, all deriving from `ConverterBase`:\n",
    "    * `Expectation`s - Traverse over an Operator and replace OperatorStateFn measurements into Z-basis or matrix measurements approximating the expectation value of the measurement.\n",
    "    * `Evolution`s - Traverse over an Operator and replace `EvolvedOp`s with circuits approximating the evolution.\n",
    "    * `CircuitSampler` - Traverse over an Operator and replace `CircuitStateFn`s with `DictStateFn`s approximating them, perhaps sampled from a quantum device.\n",
    "    * Other converters, e.g. `AbelianGrouper`, `PauliBasisChange`\n",
    "    \n",
    "Don't worry if this seems like a whirlwind. We'll discuss each of these in detail in the next section, and you can also find more detail in the [Operator flow API reference](https://qiskit.org/documentation/apidoc/qiskit.aqua.operators.html#module-qiskit.aqua.operators)."

The code is simple - we'll evolve a Bell state by an H2 Hamiltonian using a simple Trotter expansion and measure the energy expectation value of the Hamiltonian at various evolution times. You are obviously not expected to understand it, but inspect it to gain some context and see how it simplifies otherwise complex constructions. Also note that this is a slightly verbose form of this flow for instruction's sake.\n",

    "### `.eval(state)` vs `.compose(state)`\n",
    "\n",
    "Although they look similar, there is a critical difference between `eval` and `compose`. `eval` will do everything in its power to complete the evaluation, including totally unscalable computation, such as conversion to exponential-sized matrices. Compose will not perform any unscalable computation under the hood, and will simply represent the composition symbolically (returning a `ComposedOp`, see `ListOps` below) if it does not know how to complete the composition efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "`eval(state)` can be seen as a convenience for hacking, while `compose` the more typical route for actual usage within quantum algorithms. In some sense, `eval()` will always try to complete the computation its told to complete, and if the computation isn't scalable, it's up you to take more complex steps to make it faster (e.g. run it on a quantum computer)."

In those cases, you may receive a `ListOp` result (or subclass thereof) from your operation representing the lazy execution of the operation. For example, if you attempt to add together a `DictStateFn` and a `CircuitStateFn`, you'll receive a `SummedOp` representing the sum of the two. This composite State function still has a working `eval` (but may need to perform a non-scalable computation under the hood, such as converting both to vectors).\n",

    "* `coeff` - A coefficient multiplying the characteristic function. Note that `coeff` can be int, float, complex or a free `Parameter` object (from `qiskit.circuit` in Terra) to be bound later using `my_op.bind_parameters`.\n",
